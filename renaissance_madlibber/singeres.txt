"Thou see'st minstereles about thy person..."
"Hark! These fyne minstereles are singing!"
"[Let's listen! (yes)]"
"Bravely bold Sir #{user} rode forth from Camelot.."
"#{gender[0]} was not afraid to die, o' brave Sir #{user}!"
"#{gender[0]} was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways,"
"Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir #{user}!"
"#{gender[0]} was not at not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp..."
"Or to have #{gender[3]} eyes gouged out, or #{gender[3]} elbows broken..."
"To have #{gender[3]} kneecaps split and #{gender[3]} body burned away,"
"Or #{gender[3]} limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir #{user}!"
"#{gender[2]} head smashed in, #{gender[4]} heart cut out,"
"And #{gender[3]} liver removed, and..."
"[That's QUITE enough! Tell them to stop! (stop!)]"
"... DANGER!!! You and your supportive minstrels stumble onto a pack of ogres!!" 
"They are running at you and will eat you!!!"
"You run away!!! The minstrels run with you!!"
"Yet merrily they sing!"
"[Ah, methinks we can guess what they're singing...]"
"Brave Sir #{user} ran away..."
"Bravely ran away away!"
"When danger reared its ugly head, #{gender[1]} bravely turned #{gender[3]} tail and fled.."
"Yes, brave Sir #{user} turned about, and gallantly #{gender[1]} chickened out!"
"Bravely taking to #{gender[3]} feet, #{gender[1]} beat a very brave retreat!"
"Bravest of the brave, Sir #{user}!!"
