# MicroBlogger!

An awesome little Twitter client which interacts with Twitter for you via the shell.

It can...
- post a tweet
- parse your list of friends (people you follow and who follow you) and give back information such as last tweets, etc.
- send a direct message to a friend

It was super fun to build! Hope to do more of these kinds of useful little programs in the future!
